﻿# C# Advanced Programming & Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the **C# Advanced Programming & DSA** repository. This project serves as a comprehensive collection of advanced C# programming concepts and implementations of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms.

> **Status**: Active Development  
> **Target Framework**: .NET 10.0  
> **Author**: Sohil Khan

## Project Overview

This repository is designed to help developers understand and implement complex algorithms and advanced C# features. Each module is focused on a specific category of programming or DSA.

### Currently Implemented

#### 1. Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
  - Implementation: [BubbleSort.cs](file:///d:/Acess%20meditech/Csharp-Adv-Programming-DSA/SortingAlgorithms/BubbleSort.cs)
  - Features: Optimized with a `swapped` flag to stop early if the array is already sorted.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **.NET 10.0 SDK** installed on your machine.
- **Visual Studio 2022** or **Visual Studio Code** with C# Dev Kit.

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Csharp-Adv-Programming-DSA.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Csharp-Adv-Programming-DSA/SortingAlgorithms
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Future Roadmap
- [ ] Implement Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort.
- [ ] Add Data Structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees).

- [ ] Demonstrate Advanced C# concepts (Delegates, LINQ, Generics, Task Parallel Library).
